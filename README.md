# Hangman_v1.py

## Description
This project is an assignment from the course Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis hosted by Data Science Academy (https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/). It consist on the creation of a Hangman game using concepts like OOP, List Comprehension, slicing and other basic stuff. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Since this is a Python based application, it is important to have some knowledge of the programing language beforehand. In order to develop and run this project we will have to set up a Python dev environment.

**For developing**: Any text editor will do the trick. Personally I would recommend using and IDE.

- PyCharm Community Edition
- Sublime Text
- Notepad ++
- Jupyter Notebook

**Dev environment**: Installing Python will work just fine, but I would recommend installing Anaconda.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
