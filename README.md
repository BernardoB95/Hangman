## Description
This project is an assignment from the course Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis hosted by Data Science Academy (https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/). It consist on the creation of a Hangman game using concepts like OOP, List Comprehension, slicing and other basic stuff. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Since this is a Python based application, it is important to have some knowledge of the programing language beforehand. In order to develop and run this project we will have to set up a Python dev environment.

For developing: Any text editor will do the trick. Personally I would recommend using and IDE.

- PyCharm Community Edition
- Sublime Text
- Notepad ++
- Jupyter Notebook

Dev environment: Installing Python will work just fine, but I would recommend installing Anaconda.
